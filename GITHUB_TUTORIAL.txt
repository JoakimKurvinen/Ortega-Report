https://gist.github.com/patrick-ausderau/b6dbb392273eeecca8d5
these were the tasks we had to do in class, you dont have to follow the example stuff we did but just install git and etc tools.

and then following this:
https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/
to setup authentication between github and your computer.
you will need to setup a password that you will have to type in everytime you push to github.

--SETTING UP LOCAL REPOSITORY

on windows you can right click, git bash here, into the folder where you want to setup the repository for the project.

then type:
git clone git@github.com:LeoVaario/Ortega-Report.git

this will create a clone of the remote repository in github onto your local machine.

next:
git status
this should confirm that your local repository is working. If it doesnt work, it's probably because you're in wrong directory (try typing:
cd Ortega-Report
to change directory (cd) to the right one, or right click inside Ortega-Report folder and gitbash here.


--MAKING CHANGES, PUSHING AND PULLING

before changing anything on local repository, you should always PULL from remote repository in github first
type:
git pull

then add/remove/modify files at modify repository, work on game etc,

next type:
git add *

to add all new files to local repository

then type:
git commit

to commit all changes to LOCAL repository.
afterwards, you will need to type:

git push

to push your local commited repository to the remote github one.
After this step, all your changes will be visible and accesible to other members of BIGMANTYRONE

--OPENING PROJECT IN UNITY

after pulling from github, open unity, and on project selection screen click open...
navigate to Ortega-Report/BigManAsteroids_Full and select the BigManAsteroids_Full folder and click open with unity.
